Intelligent Admissions: The Future of University Decision Making with Machine Learning

This projecy currently makes use of Google Colab and ![Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and local execution requires some code be modified.

It currently loads the dataset, model file and other html templates from my personal google drive, so running this interactive python notebooks required that the project be cloned to the root of google drive ie. "My Drive".
